# EDIALS

Facial image anonymization is essential to enable privacy-preserving image data sharing. The core challenge lies in removing identity-revealing information without degrading the utility of the images, which is essential for, e.g., demographic analysis. However, existing techniques apply uniform pixel-level distortions or synthesize replacements using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which do not retain the meaningful features necessary for downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce EDIALS (Explainability-Driven Image Anonymization in Latent Space), which selectively modifies identity-specific latent features identified via explainability techniques. By applying targeted, incremental distortions in the latent space of an adversarial autoencoder, EDIALS effectively anonymizes images while preserving their analytical utility much
better than existing techniques. Empirical evaluations on a common dataset show that EDIALS achieves 0.42% re-identification risk (equivalent to random guessing) while maintaining high utility: 84.66% ùêπ1 for age, 97.91% for gender, and 82.61% for race classification. In contrast, DeepPrivacy2 ‚Äîa state-of-the-art GAN-based approach‚Äî results in a re-identification risk as large as 16.27% and lower utility: 78.32% ùêπ1, 82.58%, and 73.32% for age, gender, and race classification, respectively.
